# Create Lesson

Create a lesson file for the GenAI Python course following Will Sentance's "Hard Parts" methodology.

## Instructions

1. **Reference the source**: Check `GenAI-Python-Course/INDEX.md` for the exact lesson details
2. **Follow the structure**: Use the lesson template from `.github/instructions/lesson.instructions.md`
3. **Problem First**: Start with a real-world scenario
4. **Include diagrams**: Every lesson needs at least one Mermaid diagram
5. **Show the naive approach**: What would a beginner try first?
6. **Trace under the hood**: Step-by-step what's happening
7. **Break it**: Show where the naive approach fails
8. **Fix it**: The proper solution
9. **Practice**: Give the learner something to try

## Input Required

- Module number (e.g., 1)
- Lesson number (e.g., 1.3)
- Lesson title (from INDEX.md)

## Output

Create file at: `GenAI-Python-Course/Module-XX-Name/Lesson-XX-Title.md`

## Quality Checks

- [ ] Follows 6-step flow (Problem → Try → Trace → Breaks → Fix → Practice)
- [ ] Has Mermaid diagram
- [ ] Uses real-world analogy
- [ ] Technical terms explained AFTER the concept
- [ ] Includes key takeaways
